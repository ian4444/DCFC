        <p> The Friends of Dartmouth Fencing was founded as a way for alumni, friends, parents, and generous individuals to support the team, whether by following our accomplishments and  encouraging us as a community, or through monetary donations. </p>

        <p> As a team, we have achieved many things in recent years. We've won the New England Club Championships for the past four years, with many individuals on our team winning gold and silver medals for themselves. In 2012, the Men's team won the overall National Club Championships, and in 2014, DCFC as a whole took first at Nationals, earning us the distinction of being the top club team in the United States. Just recently, in the 2015 National Club Championships, our women's team took home first, continuing our recent streak of victories and adding to our plethora of awards and trophies. Each year, countless members of our team are recognized at competitions and by the College for their hard work and achievements as fencers, even those who joined DCFC with no fencing experience prior to Dartmouth. </p>

        <p> However, without all of your support, none of these victories would have been possible. Your support is what allows us to enjoy such success as an entirely student run club team, whether it is through encouragement at our competitions, donations that enable us to purchase equipment, or general enthusiasm and interest in what we do and what we've accomplished. We are always humbled and honored by everything you do for us; it is all thanks to you that our club has grown and expanded to what it is today.</p>

      </div>
   
      <!--COLUMN: Text Part 2 -->
      <div class= "small-6 columns">
        <p> As we mentioned before, we are an <b>entirely student run</b> organization. This characteristic of our club gives us more flexibility in how we practice and function. Most importantly, it gives us the opportunity to become closer to one another outside of team practices. We are a family, and this tight connection that we have with each other is a large reason for why we succeed, as well as how we foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for anyone to join. Unlike many other successful teams, we do not require prospective members to have any prior fencing experience, nor do we host tryouts. Instead, we accomodate anyone who shares a passion for our sport and the drive to improve </p>

        <p> However, all of this being said, our policies and unique position among even club sports require a substantial amount of funding for our equipment and competitions. Fencing is a costly sport, yet we do not believe this should discourage or prevent any interested members from joining our team. We welcome everyone, regardless of their personal financial circumstances. </p>

        <p> Following College guidelines, DCFC only sends out one request for donations per year. Any and all donations are extremely welcome, as they are vital in helping us maintain our club and continue on our track of running a highly successful team. For other information regarding our team, please refer to this website, as we update regularly, or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dartmouth.Fencing?fref=ts" style="color:#01683B">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/dartmouthfencing/" style="color:#01683B">Instagram</a>.</p>
